# MLSA-Event-Certificate-Automation
Being a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, it's our duty to share the knowledge by hosting events. And the people who attend the event earn a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Certificate of Participation. Manually making a hundred certificates can be tedious. 
But this script has got your back and can be used to generate hundreds of certificates within few seconds!

## Steps to be followed

### 1. Create a template and save in the working directory
Download the certificate template from Microsoft Teams. Type "Here" where you want the name of the certificate holder. Insert the event's name and your name in the respective places

### 2. Add the list of names in list.csv
### 3. Add your path of working directory in script.py
### 4. Create two folders
Create two folders, 'certificates-pdf' and 'certificates-word', to store all the certificates in pdf and word format, respectively
### 4. Run the script
After running the script, all the certificates world be saved in the respective folder according to their format. The certificate would be saved as 'Name.pdf' and 'Name.docx'
### 5. Final Result!
