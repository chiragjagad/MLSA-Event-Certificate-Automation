# MLSA-Event-Certificate-Automation
Being a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, it's my duty to share the knowledge by hosting events. And the people who attend the event earn a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Certificate of Participation. Manually making a hundred certificates can be tedious. But this script has got your back and can be used to generate hundreds of certificates within few seconds!

## Steps to be followed

### 1. Create a template and save in the working directory
       Download the certificate template from Microsoft Teams. Type "Here" where you want the name of the certificate holder

### 3. Add your path of working directory in script.py
### 4. Run the script
### 5. Final Result!
